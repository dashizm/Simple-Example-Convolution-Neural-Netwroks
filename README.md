This code implements a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch for the classification task on the MNIST dataset, which contains grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9).
Importing Libraries:
torch, torch.nn, and torch.nn.functional for PyTorch functionalities.
torch.utils.data.DataLoader for loading data in batches during training and testing.
torchvision.datasets and torchvision.transforms for accessing the MNIST dataset and transforming the data.
numpy and pandas for data manipulation.
sklearn.metrics.confusion_matrix for evaluating the model performance.
matplotlib.pyplot for visualizations.
Loading and Preprocessing Data:
MNIST dataset is loaded and transformed into PyTorch tensors.
Training and test data loaders are created to load data in batches.


Model Architecture:
Two convolutional layers (conv1 and conv2) followed by max-pooling layers.
Two fully connected layers (fc1 and fc2) followed by an output layer (fc3).
Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function is used after each convolutional layer and fully connected layer.
Log-softmax activation is applied to the output layer.
Training Loop:
Model training is carried out for a specified number of epochs.
Training data is passed through the model, and predictions are compared with the ground truth labels.
Loss is calculated using cross-entropy loss.
Parameters are updated using the Adam optimizer.
Training loss and accuracy are tracked for each epoch.
Testing Loop:
Model performance is evaluated on the test dataset.
No gradient is calculated since we're only testing the model.
Test data is passed through the trained model, and predictions are compared with the ground truth labels.
Test loss and accuracy are tracked.
Performance Evaluation:
Training and testing time are measured.
Final training and testing loss, as well as accuracy, are printed.
Note:
The code comments explain each step in detail, making it easier to understand the code flow and functionality.
The code is structured with clear separation of data loading, model definition, training, and testing loops, enhancing readability and maintainability.
